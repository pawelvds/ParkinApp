# ParkinApp

ParkinApp is an innovative application for reserving parking spots at the office, created to showcase the author's skills in .NET technologies and learning React. The project is an example of a well-organized and scalable project based on Clean Architecture, which focuses on Dependency Inversion and SOLID principles to ensure the isolation of individual layers of the application and facilitate the introduction of changes.

Although small, the application has rich capabilities and utilizes modern solutions and technologies such as Entity Framework, Generic Repository, Fluent Validation, Middleware, LINQ, DTO, Cache, etc.
ParkinApp is ready for changes and further development to meet future requirements.

The project is co-created by the author `Pawel` and mentor/sensei who leads the code review process and supports the development of the React-based front-end.

ParkinApp will be continued and developed further to showcase the author's skills and expand their knowledge in creating advanced applications.
